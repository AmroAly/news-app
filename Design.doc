In this App i've used Laravel Framework which uses the following design patterns:
1. Builder pattern
2. Factory pattern
3. Repository pattern
4. Strategy pattern
5. Provider pattern
6. Facade Pattern

However i've made use of the vue component that comes with laravel to serve it as Single Page Application SPA So i have only one route and multiple components.

The technologies used in this project:
- PHP7
- Laravel
- mysql
- VueJS
